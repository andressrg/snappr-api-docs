# Introduction

Welcome to the Snappr API! You can use our API to manage bookings conducted through the Snappr marketplace network. The API is available only to organizations using the Snappr enterprise Photography Portal. If you do not currently have a Photography Portal account and are interesting in setting one up, find out more <a href="https://www.snappr.co/partner">here</a>.

We have language bindings in Shell and JavaScript. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

```shell
curl "/example-endpoint" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer zkTvDUe5jJBJFcjc6ckwapEwax8Kbs7h3nv2SHXSgh5qGhHP22ggsu4fbdZgf25z"
```

```javascript
const snappr = require('snappr-api');

let api = snappr.authorize('zkTvDUe5jJBJFcjc6ckwapEwax8Kbs7h3nv2SHXSgh5qGhHP22ggsu4fbdZgf25z');
```

> Make sure to replace the example key above with your API key.

Snappr uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can access or regenerate your API key from your Photography Portal GUI. Each user has their own API key. Regenerating your API key will deactivate your API key. Deleting a user will deactivate their API key.

An API key to be included in all API requests in a header of this format:

<code>Authorization: Bearer <span class="route_param">api_key</span></code>

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>api_key</code> with your user API key.
