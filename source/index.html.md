# Introduction

Welcome to the Snappr API! You can use our API to access Snappr API endpoints, which can get information on bookings conducted through the Snappr marketplace network.

We have language bindings in Shell and JavaScript. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'snappr'

api = Snappr::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import snappr-api

api = snappr.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const snappr = require('snappr-api');

let api = snappr.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Snappr uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Snappr API key at our [developer portal](http://api.snappr.co/register).

Snappr expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Bookings

## Get All Bookings

```ruby
require 'snappr'

api = Snappr::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.bookings.get

api.bookings.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/bookings"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const snappr = require('snappr');

let api = snappr.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let bookings = api.bookings.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
